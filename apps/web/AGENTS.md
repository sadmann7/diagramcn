# Agents

## Comments

Default to no comment. Write one only for a constraint, an external quirk, or an invariant the code can't show, in one line where you can and four at most. Don't restate names, narrate steps, record history, or explain the fix you just made; the PR carries that.

- Full sentences ending with a full stop, including notes after code on the same line.
- No required verb form, and no "we" or "our".
- JSDoc only on the public API (props, options, hooks and functions users import): one sentence, no types, no empty `@param` or `@returns`. Components and parts get none, and neither do internal helpers, even ones another file imports.
- A `TODO:` links the issue that tracks it. No bare `#123`.
- No section dividers, commented-out code, or test step labels.

`diagramcn/comment-style` in `lint/comment-style.ts` enforces the mechanical parts.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
